        <h1>20 Years of U.S. Hate Crimes</h1>
        <h2> Data visualizations of U.S. hate crimes occurred between 2001 and 2020. </h2>

      <div class="padded">
        <p style="color:rgb(10, 64, 64);font-size: 16px;"> <b>Topics covered:</b><br>
          1) Hate crime volume across the U.S. states per year.<br>
          2) Changes of the incident volume over the 20 years per state.<br>
          3) Incident volume for each different bias type per year. <br>
          4) Distribution of the crimes by the offense types over the 20 years. <br>
          5) Hate crime volume for each different victim type per year.<br>
          6) Hierarchy of the place types where the crimes had occurred the most.<br><br> 
          <b>Goals:</b>
          By visualizing 20 years of the hate crime data for each of these topics, 
          I would like to find patterns of the incident, such as when the hate crimes occurred the most, 
          where these crimes took place, who the victims were, how the crimes were motivated, 
          and how the crimes were carried out.<br><br>
